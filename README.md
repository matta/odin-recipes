# odin-recipes

This is a bare bones website done as part of the Odin project at
https://theodinprojet.com.  This is
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes.

Here I was going fast and loose, because this stuff isn't much different from
the way I was making websites 30 years ago. My aim is to blitz through and get
to the modern CSS and Javascript stuff.
